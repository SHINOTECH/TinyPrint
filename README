Control software for the DPL based 3D printer 'B9Creator'. 

Installation: See INSTALL

Start and example usage on Raspberry PI:

	If the compiling went successful, the build directory contains
	the executable 'bin/main'. You could append arguments
	of the type '--dfb:[option]' to change the DirectFB settings.
	Satisfying DirectFB values depend on your system. If the default
	values does not work you should extend
	'bin/start.sh' with your desired argument tuple.
	Some example settings are already included in bin/start.sh. 

  Open a SSH connection and go into the build directory of
	TinyPrint. Call 'bin/start.sh pi' one-time
	to generate the configuration file 'b9CreatorSettings.json'.
	Quit the first run with Ctrl+C.
	Open the configuration file and  replace the value of 'comPort'
	with the serial port of the printer on your system. In most cases,
	the default value, /dev/ttyACMO, is already correct.

	As final step, restart the executable and try to open
	http://[raspberry pi IP]:9090.

	I suggest the usage of GNU Screen to detach TinyPrint 
	from the SSH connecion.

	Click on "Show Display" to start the framebuffer on the next
	free virtual console. Use Ctrl+Alt+F7 and Ctrl+Alt+F8 (or other Fx keys)
	to switch between your normal graphical interface and TinyPrint.

=================================================================

Remark:
Unfortunately, I do not know how to use Directfb without
super user rights. I assume you need to start it with
'sudo'. Or you use the parameter --dfb:system=x11.
Help would be appreciated.
