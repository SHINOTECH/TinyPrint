================================================================

Dependiencies:

i) OpenCV
ii) Directfb
iii) Boost
iv) Onion 
v) librsvg2 (later)

----------------------------------------------------------------

Installation of required libraries on Debian based systems (State Oct 2012 ):

i) sudo apt-get install libopencv-core-dev libopencv-highgui-dev
ii) sudo apt-get install libdirectfb-dev
iii) sudo apt-get install libboost-signals-dev
iv) This lib has to be installed manually.
	I.e.:
	cd TinyPrint
	git clone https://github.com/davidmoreno/onion.git
	cd onion
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../../lib/onion ..
	make
	make install

v) sudo apt-get install librsvg2-dev 


================================================================

Configuration and Compiling:

	This project use the cmake as makefile generator. You can 
	use the common steps:
		cd TinyPrint
		mkdir build
		cd build
		cmake ..
		make

=================================================================

Start and setup software:

If the compiling went successful, the build directory contains the executable
'bin/main'.  Go into the build dir, and call 'bin/main' to generate the
configuration file 'b9CreatorSettings.ini' and quit the program with Ctrl+C.
Plug in your printer and check if the
value of the 'comPort' variable (default: /dev/ttyACM0) match with the correct serial port on your system.

As final step, I execute the software as super user (sudo bin/main).
Unfortunately, I do not know how you could use Directfb without super user rights. Help would be appreciated.
