Dependiencies:
(i)   CMake
(ii)  OpenCV
(iii) Directfb
(iv)  Boost
(v)   Cairo and librsvg2 
(vi)  Onion 

----------------------------------------------------------------

Installation of required libraries on Debian based systems (State Oct 2012 ):

i-v)
sudo apt-get install cmake  \
libopencv-dev libopencv-core-dev libopencv-highgui-dev \
libboost-signals-dev libboost-iostreams-dev libboost-system-dev libboost-filesystem-dev \
libdirectfb-dev \
librsvg2-dev libcairo2-dev

vi) This lib has to be installed manually.
	I.e.:
	cd TinyPrint
	git clone https://github.com/davidmoreno/onion.git
	cd onion
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../../lib/onion ..
	make
	make install

Installation of required libraries on other systems:

================================================================

Configuration and Compiling:

	This project use the cmake as makefile generator. You can 
	use the common steps:
		cd TinyPrint
		mkdir build
		cd build
		cmake ..
		make

=================================================================

Start and setup software:

If the compiling went successful, the build directory contains
the executable 'bin/main'. To setup the correct DirectFB parameter
you could append arguments of the type '--dfb:[option]'.
Satisfying values depend on your system and you should extend
'bin/start.sh' with your desired argument tuple.
Some example settings are already included in bin/start.sh. 

Go into the build dir, and call 'bin/start.sh' one-time
to generate the configuration file 'b9CreatorSettings.json'.
Quit the first run with Ctrl+C.
Open the configuration file and  replace the value of 'comPort'
with the serial port of the printer on your system. In most cases,
the default value, /dev/ttyACMO, are already correct.

As final step, restart the executable and try to open
http://[your machine]:9090.

=================================================================

Remark:
Unfortunately, I do not know how to use Directfb without
super user rights. I assume you need to start it with
'sudo'. Help would be appreciated.
